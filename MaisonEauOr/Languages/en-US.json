  "aboutText": "We are warmly welcomed at the Ydentik boutique located at 123 Avenue René Coté in Le Havre.",
  "aboutText2": " Their concept is to create unique and personalized perfumes. I find the idea brilliant. The decor is chic and clean in white colors, perfume bottles fill one side of the wall like in bars, and on the other side, we discover the scents of the blends. Most often, we know well that in a perfume, it's the brand and packaging that we pay for, but here, that's no longer the case. The team is welcoming and attentive. It's up to you to compose your perfume with their advice. Once you've chosen your ingredients, they prepare your unique perfume cocktail.",
